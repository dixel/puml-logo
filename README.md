*collection of 100x100 images to use in plantuml diagrams*

## Motivation
Diagram tooling is bad. Plantuml is a bit better then everything else but it is still a tool made by engineers for engineers.
A big advantage - it's embeddable in many document exchange systems (confluence) and other drawing tools (draw.io).
This is my attempt to make it a bit nicer for personal usage.
